# Homework 1 - Prerequisite Test

## Overview 

In this homework you will develop a simple cycle accurate digital logic simulator in C++. It demonstrates the principles on how to reason about hardware performance completely in SW all while exposing  you to the basic concepts and tools. 

You will build a simple design with a clock generator that alternates a clock signal on every cycle, a counter that connects to the clock and increases count on every risign edge. Later you will insert a clock divider between the clock generator and the counter to reduce the clock frequency (which validates the modularity of your design).

Generative AI (such as ChatGPT, CoPilot) is not allowed for this assignment. 

## Assignment Steps

The instructions for ths lab are detailed in the following steps:

1. (Reserved for feedback branch pull request. You will receive top level feedback there).
2. [Getting Started](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/2.%20Getting%20Started.md)
3. [Instanciate Simulation Engine](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/3.%20Instanciate%20Simulation%20Engine.md)
4. [Clock Generator and VCD Trace](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/4.%20Clock%20Generator%20and%20VCD%20Trace.md)
5. [Counter](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/5.%20Counter.md)
6. [Insert Clock Divider](.github/STARTING_ISSUES/6.%20Insert%20Clock%20Divider.md)

After accepting this assignment in github classroom, each step is converted into a [github issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues). Follow the issues in numerically increasing issue number (the first issue is typically on the bottom of the list).

## General Instructions

Please commit your code frequently or at e very logical break. Each commit should have a meaningful commit message and [cross reference](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests) the issue the commit belongs to. Ideally, there would be no commits without referencing to a github issue. 

Please comment on each issue with the problems faced and your approach to solve them. Close an issue when done.
