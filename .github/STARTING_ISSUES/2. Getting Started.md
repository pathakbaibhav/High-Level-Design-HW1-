Create a C++ source file ```countersim.cpp``` (e.g. a [hello world](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus-hello-world-program)) in the ```src``` directory. Create a [Makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) ([Tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com/)) to compile the code if the source file has changed. Add a "[clean](https://www.positioniseverything.net/make-clean)" rule to the Makefile, as well as a test rule that executes your binary (```countersim```).
