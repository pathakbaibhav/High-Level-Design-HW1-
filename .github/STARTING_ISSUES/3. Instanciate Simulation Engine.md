Instanciate a global instance of Simulator (see src/simengine.h) called ```sim``` to run for 100 time units. Update main to run the simulation engine and print simulation time when finished. Update Makefile. 

In general, ```simegine.cpp``` and ```simengine.h``` should only contain code that is independent of a particular simulation instance. So, don't move design specific code in there. In other words,  you should be able to simulate a completely different design by using the ```simengine.h``` interface. 

Instantiate the Simulator class in your main design file ```countersim``` and call the unmodified ```run``` method from there.
