Create a clock divider ```ClkDiv``` that is connected to a wire  ```bool myClkDiv```. After each 4 edges (rising and falling) ```ClkDiv``` should flip the logic state of ```myClkDiv```. You can use some of your ```Counter``` implementation as a starting point. 

Connect ```myClkDiv``` to the VCD tracing (similar to ```myClk``` tracing). Validate correct behavior of ```myClkDiv```. Copy and commit the vcd file as ```results/clkDiv.vcd```.

Upate ```Counter``` to take the input of ```myClkDiv``` instead of ```myClk```. Adjust the order of ```register_module()``` calls to reflect the dependency order.  

Validate output with GTKWave. Copy and commit the vcd file as ```results/clkDivCounter.vcd```.
