Implement a class ```Counter``` that connects to ```myClk``` as an input and to ```unsigned int myCount``` as an output. On each rising clock edge (i.e. transition from false to true) the counter ```myCount``` should increase by value of 1. 

Add VCD tracing to the ```myCount```. Create the vcd variable and update it with, e.g.: 

```C++
vcd::VarPtr vcdVarCnt = sim.pWriter->register_var("Main", "myCnt", vcd::VariableType::wire, 8);

unsigned int value = 7;
pWriter->change(vcdVarCnt, sim.time_get(), std::bitset<8>(value).to_string())
```

Validate that the clock is displayed with GTKWave. Copy and commit the vcd file as ```results/counter.vcd```.
